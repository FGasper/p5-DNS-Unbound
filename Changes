Revision history for Perl module DNS::Unbound

0.25
- BUG FIX: Make the C code not depend on (pure) Perl for memory handling.
  This intends to fix some longstanding (and hard-to-reproduce)
  memory-handling nits, but it’s also just much cleaner besides.
- BUG FIX: We now honour $Config{'ccflags'} when building the module.
  (This broke at some point on 32-bit RaspiOS.)
- Objects now warn() on DESTROY at global destruction.
- Fix t/load.t:
    - The test now runs to completion rather than silently failing.
    - The test now accommodates old Unbounds that lack `ttl`.
    - Long TTLs. Unbound’s default was 86400, so responses
      that had longer TTLs caused a conflict between Net::DNS’s parse
      and Unbound’s response.
- Internal style improvements.
- All tests now fail on warnings.

0.24 Tue, 27 Jul 2021
- BUG FIX: Several memory leaks from errantly-high reference counts.
- Various tweaks for efficiency: pre-extend arrays, etc.

0.23 Tue, 1 Jun 2021
- Make unbound_version() a regular XSUB rather than a constant. This avoids
  the need to recompile perlcc-compiled binaries when updating Unbound.

0.22 Thu, 25 Feb 2021
- BUG FIX: Use byte representation to send strings to C. This fixes
  encoding problems with non-ASCII strings.

0.21 Sat, 9 Jan 2021
- Fix author test resolvconf.t after default port changed from 53 to 5353
  in Net::DNS::Nameserver version 1.28.
- Special classes for AnyEvent, IO::Async, and Mojolicious are added.
- Spruce up typemap’s mismatch error reporting.
- Internal improvements.

0.20 Mon, 3 Aug 2020
- BUG FIX: Don’t free the unbound context if its reference is already gone.
- BUG FIX: Use the “real” finally() rather than wrapping then() (badly).
- Trivial simplification to XS code.

0.19 Tue, 18 Feb 2020
- Fix compatibility with old libunbounds that didn’t include ub_result.ttl.
- Forgo version detection in favor of feature detection.
- Fail Makefile.PL on systems where libunbound or its header is unavailable.
- Make tests output UTF-8.
- Fix a couple test warnings on old perls.

0.18 Fri, 31 Jan 2020
- Skip unreliable resolvconf test when installing the module.

0.17 Fri, 31 Jan 2020
- BREAKING CHANGE: DNSSEC functions (introduced in 0.15) now throw errors and
  return $self.
- Add hosts() and resolvconf() methods.
- The Promise::ES6 async query implementation is now always loaded.

0.16 Sun, 5 Jan 2020
- Fix use with old libunbound versions.
- (undocumented) experimental support for promise engines besides Promise::ES6

0.15 Thu, 2 Jan 2020
- Add DNSSEC setup (i.e., trust anchor) methods.

0.14 - Thu, 14 Nov 2019
- Rewrite AsyncQuery.pm to avoid Promise::ES6 internals.

0.13 - Fri, 8 Nov 2019
- BUG FIX: Accommodate having AsyncQuery.pm loaded at compile time.
- Add answer_packet() accessor to DNS::Unbound::Result.
- Deprecate to_net_dns_rrs().
- Add examples to demonstrate interaction with AnyEvent and IO::Async.

0.12 - Sat, 14 Sep 2019
- Rename count_pending_promises() to count_pending_queries().

0.11 - Sat, 14 Sep 2019
- Fix memory leak when an asynchronous query is canceled.
- Add count_pending_promises() method.

0.10 - Mon, 26 Aug 2019
- Query results are now represented as instances of DNS::Unbound::Result
  rather than simple hash references. Existing implementations should
  continue to work.
- DNS::Unbound::Result’s method to convert a query result to Net::DNS::RR
  instances obviates the need to decode query results manually.
  The decode_name() and decode_character_strings() functions will be
  retained as a convenience for contexts where they’re useful.
- resolve() and resolve_async() now fall back on Net::DNS::Parameters
  to parse any unrecognized query types.

0.09 - Sat, 27 July 2019
- Remove dependency on recent ExtUtils::MakeMaker version.
- Split DNS::Unbound::AsyncQuery off to a separate file; add POD & test.
- Beef up documentation.

0.08 - Thu, 13 June 2019
- Tweak verbiage (no code changes)

0.07 - Sun, 9 June 2019
- Add error checking for debugout().
- Work around libunbound debugout bug (https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/issues/39)

0.06 - Fri, 7 June 2019
- Add debug control support.

0.05 - Fri, 7 June 2019
- Add asynchronous query support.
- Fix instantiation of ResolveError exception.

0.04 - Sun, 19 May 2019
- BUG FIX: Prevent excess destruction of context struct.
- OPTIMIZATION: Store ints as IV rather than NV.

0.03 - Thu, 16 May 2019
- Fix bugtracker in Makefile.PL.

0.02 - Mon, 25 March 2019
- Resolve configure_requires issue.
- Fix dangling “1;” in POD.
