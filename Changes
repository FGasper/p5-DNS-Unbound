Revision history for Perl module DNS::Unbound

0.17 Fri, 31 Jan 2020
- BREAKING CHANGE: DNSSEC functions (introduced in 0.15) now throw errors and
  return $self.
- Add hosts() and resolvconf() methods.
- The Promise::ES6 async query implementation is now always loaded.

0.16 Sun, 5 Jan 2020
- Fix use with old libunbound versions.
- (undocumented) experimental support for promise engines besides Promise::ES6

0.15 Thu, 2 Jan 2020
- Add DNSSEC setup (i.e., trust anchor) methods.

0.14 - Thu, 14 Nov 2019
- Rewrite AsyncQuery.pm to avoid Promise::ES6 internals.

0.13 - Fri, 8 Nov 2019
- BUG FIX: Accommodate having AsyncQuery.pm loaded at compile time.
- Add answer_packet() accessor to DNS::Unbound::Result.
- Deprecate to_net_dns_rrs().
- Add examples to demonstrate interaction with AnyEvent and IO::Async.

0.12 - Sat, 14 Sep 2019
- Rename count_pending_promises() to count_pending_queries().

0.11 - Sat, 14 Sep 2019
- Fix memory leak when an asynchronous query is canceled.
- Add count_pending_promises() method.

0.10 - Mon, 26 Aug 2019
- Query results are now represented as instances of DNS::Unbound::Result
  rather than simple hash references. Existing implementations should
  continue to work.
- DNS::Unbound::Result’s method to convert a query result to Net::DNS::RR
  instances obviates the need to decode query results manually.
  The decode_name() and decode_character_strings() functions will be
  retained as a convenience for contexts where they’re useful.
- resolve() and resolve_async() now fall back on Net::DNS::Parameters
  to parse any unrecognized query types.
