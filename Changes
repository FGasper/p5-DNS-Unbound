Revision history for Perl module DNS::Unbound

0.10 - Mon, 26 Aug 2019
- Query results are now represented as instances of DNS::Unbound::Result
  rather than simple hash references. Existing implementations should
  continue to work.
- DNS::Unbound::Result’s method to convert a query result to Net::DNS::RR
  instances obviates the need to decode query results manually.
  The decode_name() and decode_character_strings() functions will be
  retained as a convenience for contexts where they’re useful.
- resolve() and resolve_async() now fall back on Net::DNS::Parameters
  to parse any unrecognized query types.
